**Data Science & Machine Learning Projects**

This repository showcases three advanced projects demonstrating end-to-end workflows in data science, machine learning, computer vision, and NLP.

**1️⃣ Retail Analytics & Forecasting**

**Objective:** Optimize inventory management and automate restocking decisions using predictive analytics.

**DataSet:** <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirmotefaker/supply-chain-dataset/></a>

**End-to-end pipeline:** 

-- data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis.

-- Applied clustering, PCA/t-SNE, anomaly detection, and time series forecasting (ARIMA, LSTM).

-- Built a recommender system for restocking and created interactive dashboards for decision-making.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, ARIMA.

**Results:**

-- Reduced stockouts and improved inventory planning.

-- Interactive visualizations enabled actionable business insights.

**2️⃣ Human Activity Recognition (HAR)**

**Objective:** Classify human activities from images using deep learning.

**Dataset:** 15-class activity image dataset

**Key Features:**

-- Performed EDA, normalization, and data splitting for images.

-- Used transfer learning with MobileNetV2 for feature extraction and CNN classification.

-- Hyperparameter tuning and prediction on unseen images with visualizations.

**Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

**Results:**

-- Accurate classification of 15 human activity classes.

-- Scalable pipeline for deployment and experimentation.

**3️⃣ Text Summarization with NLP**

**Objective:** Generate concise summaries from news articles using extractive and abstractive methods.

**Dataset:** News Category Dataset

**Key Features:**

-- Data preprocessing: cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, and feature engineering.

-- Implemented extractive (TF-IDF, LSA) and abstractive (T5, BART, GPT) summarization models.

-- Evaluated performance using ROUGE metrics and applied interpretability techniques (attention maps/SHAP).

**Tech Stack:** Python, Hugging Face Transformers, NLTK, SpaCy, TensorFlow/PyTorch

**Results:**

High-quality summarization on unseen news articles.

Explainable and interpretable summaries using attention maps.
