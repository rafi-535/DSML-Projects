## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Retail Analytics & Forecasting
**Objective:** Optimize inventory management and automate restocking decisions using predictive analytics.  
**Dataset:** Real-world retail sales and inventory data  

**End-to-End Pipeline:**
- Data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis  
- Applied clustering, PCA/t-SNE, anomaly detection, and time series forecasting (ARIMA, LSTM)  
- Built a recommender system for restocking and interactive dashboards  

**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, ARIMA  

**Results:**  
- Reduced stockouts and improved inventory planning  
- Interactive visualizations enabled actionable business insights

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Text Summarization with NLP
**Objective:** Generate concise summaries from news articles using extractive and abstractive methods  
**Dataset:** News Category Dataset  

**Key Features:**  
- Data preprocessing: cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, and feature engineering  
- Extractive (TF-IDF, LSA) and abstractive (T5, BART, GPT) summarization models  
- Evaluation using ROUGE metrics and interpretability (attention maps/SHAP)  

**Tech Stack:** Python, Hugging Face Transformers, NLTK, SpaCy, TensorFlow/PyTorch  

**Results:**  
- High-quality summarization on unseen articles
